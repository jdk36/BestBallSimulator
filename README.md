### Best Ball Simulator
This is a simulator which will help you gauge your chance to win your MFL10 leage, based on your roster.  You enter your players as a comination of five parameters which relate to your projection for that player's upcoming performance.  These are:
#### Average Non-Touchdown Points
On average, how many points that are *not* from TD's do you expect your player to score, per week, in the upcoming season.
#### Standard Deviation
Specifically, this is the standard deviation of the above number, the non-TD points per week.
#### Average TD's
The average amount of TD's your player will score per week.  For example, for a player who scored 8 TD's last year, 8/16, or .5, is a good projection.  This number does *not* need to be an integer (and, in fact, probably shouldn't be).
#### Preseason Bust Rate
A percentage value, which indicates your approximated chance that the player will bust before the season even starts.  This parameter approximates things like a torn ACL in the preseason, getting buried on the depth chart, hitting your kid, etc.  For early drafted players, this is usually very low, whereas for lotto tickets you draft late, you should pick a number which is very high.
#### Weekly Bust Rate
Basically the chance of your player suffering a season ending injuy in any given week, and giving you zero points per week after that.  You can project this however you want, but in general, your weekly bust rates should be highest for TE's, and should then follow the order of: TE > RB > WR > QB, based on historical data about each position.
